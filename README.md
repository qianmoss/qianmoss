From the moment I wrote my first line of code, technology has been more than a career. it has been a canvas for creation, a toolkit for problem-solving, and a shield for protection. With over 16 years of experience in software development and cybersecurity, I am the founder of Cartian, where innovation and security are not just priorities. they are the core of every project.

Throughout my journey, Iâ€™ve architected complex systems, led cross-functional teams, and delivered solutions that are secure, user-centric, and scalable. I thrive at the intersection of creativity and technology, constantly exploring ways to make businesses and lives smarter, safer, and more efficient.

For me, security is not merely a skill. itâ€™s a mission. A mission to safeguard data, build trust, and create tangible value for organizations and the people they serve.
